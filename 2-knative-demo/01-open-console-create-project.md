In the Terminal window to the right, the install script is installing the Knative components onto this OpenShift cluster.
This will take a few minutes to complete.  While this is proceeding we are going to open the OpenShift Web Console.  To 
do this click on the "OpenShift Console" tab next to the "Terminal" tab.  This will open the OpenShift Web Console in a
new browser tab/window.
