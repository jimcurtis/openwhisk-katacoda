## Conclusion

During this demo of Knative on OpenShift, we've successfully touched many aspects of what Knative has to offer today. 
We've built a Knative application from scratch, making use of OpenShifts existing rich Build support. We've further seen 
how to hook that application up with an arbitrary event source, to feed that data to our application in a declarative 
fashion. Lastly, we've seen how Knative scaled our application according to the needs of incoming traffic and even scaled 
the application down to zero instances, when no traffic was coming in at all.
